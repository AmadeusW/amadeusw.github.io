I want to test how syntax highlighting looks like

### Here it comes

Okay, here we go:
```csharp
        public IEnumerable<string> GetGreetings()
        {
            foreach (var student in Students)
            {
                var greeting = new Greetings(student.Name);
                yield return greeting.Greet();
            }
        }
```

And some `inline` code as well.

This should be enough.
