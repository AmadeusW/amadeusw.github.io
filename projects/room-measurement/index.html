When looking for a place to live, far too often I&rsquo;d be unable to fit in a house I visited.</p><p>To save time and visit only houses where I&rsquo;d be comfortable in, I created a simple tool to extrapolate height of the room based on height of a known object, such as electrical socket that&rsquo;s 5" tall.</p><p><a href=https://github.com/amadeusw/measure>github.com/amadeusw/measure</a></p><p>Due to <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS>CORS</a> restrictions, I couldn&rsquo;t get the images to open at my website. To work around this, I made this tool a browser extension. When running as a browser extension, there are no CORS issues. To estimate size of the room:</p><ol><li><a href=https://github.com/AmadeusW/measure/releases/download/0%2C2/measure.0.2.crx>Install the extension</a></li><li>Think of a feature of known size, such as electric socket. Adjust it&rsquo;s height (default 4.5")</li><li>Click on the top and bottom of the electric socket</li><li>Click on locations in line with the socket where the wall meets the floor and the ceiling</li><li>The tool estimates height of the room</li></ol><p>The tool is finished only to extent necessary to accomplish its task, and no final polish was applied beyond that.</p></main></article><footer><span><a href=/about/>//AW</a></span>
