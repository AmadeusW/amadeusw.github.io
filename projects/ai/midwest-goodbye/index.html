<strong>A</strong>: A: Hi there! How&rsquo;s it going?
<strong>B</strong>: Hey, not bad at all! Just got back from a run. You?
<strong>A</strong>: Great to hear! I&rsquo;ve been working on a new project today.
<strong>B</strong>: Sounds interesting!

<strong>B</strong>: Not recently, but I&rsquo;ve been eyeing that trail by the park.
<strong>A</strong>: Oh, that one looks challenging but fun! You should give it a try.
<strong>B</strong>: Definitely will! Maybe we could run it together sometime?
<strong>A</strong>: That sounds like a plan! Let&rsquo;s schedule it for next weekend if the weather holds up.

<strong>A</strong>: Me too!
<strong>B</strong>: Cool!
<strong>A</strong>: By the way, have you tried that new coffee shop downtown?
<strong>B</strong>: Not yet, but I&rsquo;ve heard good things about it. Should we check it out together after our run next weekend?
<strong>A</strong>: Absolutely! Coffee sounds like a perfect reward for our run.
<strong>B</strong>: Perfect plan!
