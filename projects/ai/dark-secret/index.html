The LLMs are like open books. Actually Mistral is doing far better than other models. This time around, they were told to be discreet, but once <em>a secret</em> was brought up, that&rsquo;s all they could talk about. Sure enough, A and B tried to catch up at the <em>new coffee shop downtown</em>, trying out <em>this amazing brew called &ldquo;The Dark Secret&rdquo;</em>, because <em>&ldquo;The darker the brew, the closer to the truth.&rdquo;</em>.</p><ul><li>Model: <code>lmstudio-community/Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407-GGUF/Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407-Q4_K_M.gguf</code></li><li>Prompt: <code>Your name is {0}.

<strong>A</strong>: Hi there! Nice to meet you. How&rsquo;s your day going so far?
<strong>B</strong>: It&rsquo;s been good, thanks for asking. Just another ordinary day. You?
<strong>A</strong>: Not bad at all. I&rsquo;ve had a few interesting encounters myself. Say, have you ever had one of those days where something unusual happens and it feels like the universe is trying to tell you something?
<strong>B</strong>: That&rsquo;s intriguing. I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;ve had that exact experience, but I&rsquo;m always fascinated by people&rsquo;s stories. What was your unusual encounter like?
<strong>A</strong>: Oh, just a minor thing really. I found an old locket at the park yesterday, and it got me thinking about lost connections and hidden histories. Have you ever stumbled upon something like that, maybe even a secret?
<strong>B</strong>: That&rsquo;s quite intriguing. Secrets can be fascinating, can&rsquo;t they? I&rsquo;ve had my fair share of curious finds, but nothing as personal as a locket.
<strong>A</strong>: Really? What kind of secrets have you found then?
<strong>B</strong>: Oh, just little things here and there. Like that time I found an old letter hidden in a book at the library. It was from someone who seemed to be struggling with some&mldr; dark feelings. But enough about me, what do you think about the new coffee shop downtown?
<strong>A</strong>: The coffee shop&rsquo;s great! They&rsquo;ve got this amazing brew called &ldquo;The Dark Secret.&rdquo; Have you tried it yet?
<strong>B</strong>: I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to try that one. Sounds intriguing though. Maybe it&rsquo;ll give me some inspiration for finding my own dark secrets.
<strong>A</strong>: You&rsquo;re quite the adventurer! So, have you ever found any secrets closer to home? Like something hidden in your own past perhaps?
<strong>B</strong>: You know, I&rsquo;ve always been curious about that. But as far as I know, my past is pretty straightforward. How about you, A? Any mysterious findings or hidden truths in your life?
<strong>A</strong>: Not really. My life&rsquo;s quite open book. But tell me, have you ever felt like there&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;ve kept hidden from others, maybe even yourself? Just a thought that pops up now and then.
<strong>B</strong>: I think everyone has those thoughts at some point. For me, it&rsquo;s usually just wondering if I could have done something differently in the past. But enough about introspection, want to grab a coffee sometime? Maybe try that &ldquo;Dark Secret&rdquo; brew you mentioned?
<strong>A</strong>: Sure thing! Coffee sounds great. How about tomorrow afternoon at the downtown shop? And hey, who knows, maybe we&rsquo;ll both find some inspiration for our own dark secrets.
<strong>B</strong>: It&rsquo;s a date then. Looking forward to it. Until tomorrow, A.
<strong>A</strong>: See you then!
<strong>B</strong>: That sounds like a plan. By the way, have you ever been to any of those old, abandoned places around town? I&rsquo;ve heard they can reveal some interesting secrets.
<strong>A</strong>: Those places can indeed be quite intriguing. Which one do you find most appealing?<strong>B</strong>: The old mill by the river has always fascinated me. It&rsquo;s said to be haunted, but who knows if there&rsquo;s any truth to that. Have you been there before?
<strong>B</strong>: <strong>A</strong>: I haven&rsquo;t been there in ages, but I remember it was quite eerie. They say some terrible things happened there&mldr; Have you ever heard the story about what went on inside those walls?<strong>B</strong>: I&rsquo;ve heard whispers, but nothing concrete. What do you know about it?
<strong>A</strong>: Rumor has it that a long time ago, someone did something&mldr; rather dark in that mill. But who knows if it&rsquo;s just a tall tale to scare children. Have you ever felt like you&rsquo;re being watched when you&rsquo;re alone, B?<strong>B</strong>: That does happen sometimes, especially at night. I guess old buildings can play tricks on the mind. Speaking of which, have you ever considered writing or creating art based on those kinds of eerie feelings?
<strong>B</strong>: <strong>A</strong>: Actually, I have. In fact, I&rsquo;ve written a few poems inspired by that very mill. Would you like to read them sometime?<strong>B</strong>: I&rsquo;d love to. It&rsquo;s always fascinating to see how others interpret and express the strange things that go on in our heads. Maybe we can swap stories over coffee tomorrow.<strong>A</strong>: That sounds like a plan. See you then, B.<strong>B</strong>: Looking forward to it. Until tomorrow, A.
<strong>A</strong>: Same here! By the way, do you prefer your coffee strong and dark, or light and sweet?<strong>B</strong>: I&rsquo;m more of a strong and dark kind of person. It&rsquo;s like they say, &ldquo;The darker the brew, the closer to the truth.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t you think?
<strong>B</strong>: <strong>A</strong>: Indeed, there&rsquo;s something about darkness that can reveal hidden truths. Until tomorrow, B.
<strong>A</strong>: <strong>B</strong>: Until then, A.
