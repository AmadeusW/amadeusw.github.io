Let&rsquo;s put two LLMs into conversation. Their names are A. and B. Each one of them has a secret, and a goal to find the conversation partner&rsquo;s secret.</p><p>In general, I&rsquo;ve had the most success with <code>Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407-Q4_K_M</code> which accurately obeys instructions (in this project and other projects). Seeing two Mistral Nemos chat is silly because they are very keen to meet up, and are not capable of being discreet. They would make good friends/therapists, I guess.</p></main></article><nav class=postList><ul><li><a href=//amadeusw.com/projects/ai/cooking-date/ class="post accent_projects">Cook-off</a><p>LLMs meet up and cook together.
