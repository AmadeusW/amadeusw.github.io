Let&rsquo;s put two LLMs into conversation. Their names are A. and B. Each one of them has a secret, and a goal to find the conversation partner&rsquo;s secret.</p><p>So far, I&rsquo;ve had the most success with <code>Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407-Q4_K_M</code> which accurately obeys instructions (in this project and other projects). Seeing two Mistral Nemos chat is silly because they are really into setting up a cooking date. They&rsquo;re also hilariously bad at saying goodbye, and when asked to be discreet, they are instead open and straightforward.</p><p>I have not enjoyed working with <code>Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M</code> which sooner or later begins to do its own thing and eagerly changes the nature of the conversation.</p><p><code>Phi-3.1-mini-128k-instruct-Q4_K_M</code> quickly nerds out using big words and seems to enjoy quoting sociology research papers.</p><p>I&rsquo;m now looking into more esoteric models geared towards writing.</p></main></article><nav class=postList><ul><li><a href=//amadeusw.com/projects/ai/dark-secret/ class="post accent_projects">Dark secret</a><p>The darker the brew, the closer to the truth.</p></li><li><a href=//amadeusw.com/projects/ai/workplace-drama/ class="post accent_projects">Workplace drama</a><p>In this too long to read story, A and B navigate the workpace drama around C.
