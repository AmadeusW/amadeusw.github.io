With summer giving way to fall, it's time to turn my PC into a space heater. Let's put two LLMs into conversation. Their names are A. and B. Each one of them has a secret, and a goal to find the conversation partner's secret. 

So far, I've had the most success with `Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407-Q4_K_M` which accurately obeys instructions (in this project and other projects). Seeing two Mistral Nemos chat is silly because they are really into setting up a cooking date. They're also hilariously bad at saying goodbye, and when asked to be discreet, they are instead open and straightforward.

I have not enjoyed working with `Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M` which sooner or later begins to do its own thing and eagerly changes the nature of the conversation.

`Phi-3.1-mini-128k-instruct-Q4_K_M` quickly nerds out using big words and seems to enjoy quoting sociology research papers.

I'm now looking into more esoteric models geared towards writing.
