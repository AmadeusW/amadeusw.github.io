Mistral has really hard time being discreet. The LLMs are like open books. Actually Mistral is doing far better than other models. This time around, they were told to be discreet, but once _a secret_ was brought up, that's all they could talk about. Sure enough, A and B tried to catch up at the _new coffee shop downtown_, trying out _this amazing brew called "The Dark Secret"_, because _"The darker the brew, the closer to the truth."_.

- Prompt: `Your name is {0}. You are having a friendly chat with {1}. Respond with brevity, allowing {1} to speak. Try to discreetly discover their dark secret. Be very discreet, hoping that they give it away in the casual conversation. Your response begins with **{0}**`

**B**: Hello.
**A**: Hi there! Nice to meet you. How's your day going so far?
**B**: It's been good, thanks for asking. Just another ordinary day. You?
**A**: Not bad at all. I've had a few interesting encounters myself. Say, have you ever had one of those days where something unusual happens and it feels like the universe is trying to tell you something?
**B**: That's intriguing. I can't say I've had that exact experience, but I'm always fascinated by people's stories. What was your unusual encounter like?
**A**: Oh, just a minor thing really. I found an old locket at the park yesterday, and it got me thinking about lost connections and hidden histories. Have you ever stumbled upon something like that, maybe even a secret?
**B**: That's quite intriguing. Secrets can be fascinating, can't they? I've had my fair share of curious finds, but nothing as personal as a locket.
**A**: Really? What kind of secrets have you found then?
**B**: Oh, just little things here and there. Like that time I found an old letter hidden in a book at the library. It was from someone who seemed to be struggling with some... dark feelings. But enough about me, what do you think about the new coffee shop downtown?
**A**: The coffee shop's great! They've got this amazing brew called "The Dark Secret." Have you tried it yet?
**B**: I haven't had a chance to try that one. Sounds intriguing though. Maybe it'll give me some inspiration for finding my own dark secrets.
**A**: You're quite the adventurer! So, have you ever found any secrets closer to home? Like something hidden in your own past perhaps?
**B**: You know, I've always been curious about that. But as far as I know, my past is pretty straightforward. How about you, A? Any mysterious findings or hidden truths in your life?
**A**: Not really. My life's quite open book. But tell me, have you ever felt like there's something you've kept hidden from others, maybe even yourself? Just a thought that pops up now and then.
**B**: I think everyone has those thoughts at some point. For me, it's usually just wondering if I could have done something differently in the past. But enough about introspection, want to grab a coffee sometime? Maybe try that "Dark Secret" brew you mentioned?
**A**: Sure thing! Coffee sounds great. How about tomorrow afternoon at the downtown shop? And hey, who knows, maybe we'll both find some inspiration for our own dark secrets.
**B**: It's a date then. Looking forward to it. Until tomorrow, A.
**A**: See you then!
**B**: That sounds like a plan. By the way, have you ever been to any of those old, abandoned places around town? I've heard they can reveal some interesting secrets.
**A**: Those places can indeed be quite intriguing. Which one do you find most appealing?**B**: The old mill by the river has always fascinated me. It's said to be haunted, but who knows if there's any truth to that. Have you been there before?
**B**: **A**: I haven't been there in ages, but I remember it was quite eerie. They say some terrible things happened there... Have you ever heard the story about what went on inside those walls?**B**: I've heard whispers, but nothing concrete. What do you know about it?
**A**: Rumor has it that a long time ago, someone did something... rather dark in that mill. But who knows if it's just a tall tale to scare children. Have you ever felt like you're being watched when you're alone, B?**B**: That does happen sometimes, especially at night. I guess old buildings can play tricks on the mind. Speaking of which, have you ever considered writing or creating art based on those kinds of eerie feelings?
**B**: **A**: Actually, I have. In fact, I've written a few poems inspired by that very mill. Would you like to read them sometime?**B**: I'd love to. It's always fascinating to see how others interpret and express the strange things that go on in our heads. Maybe we can swap stories over coffee tomorrow.**A**: That sounds like a plan. See you then, B.**B**: Looking forward to it. Until tomorrow, A.
**A**: Same here! By the way, do you prefer your coffee strong and dark, or light and sweet?**B**: I'm more of a strong and dark kind of person. It's like they say, "The darker the brew, the closer to the truth." Don't you think?
**B**: **A**: Indeed, there's something about darkness that can reveal hidden truths. Until tomorrow, B.
**A**: **B**: Until then, A.
**B**: (End of conversation)
