Craftsman houses are charming, but being 100 years old, their rooms are far too short for a tall individual like me. When looking for a place to live, far too often I'd be unable to fit in a house I visited.

To save time and visit only houses where I'd be comfortable in, I created a simple tool to extrapolate height of the room based on height of a known object, such as electrical socket that's 5" tall.

To estimate size of the room:
1. Load a photo of the room. Due to [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) restrictions, you must save the file to disk first. 
1. Click on the top and bottom of an electric socket
1. Click on locations in line with the socket where the wall meets the floor and the ceiling
1. The tool estimates height of the room

As you can see, the tool is finished only to extent necessary to accomplish its task, and no final polish was applied beyond that.
