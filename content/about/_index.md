Hi, my name is Amadeus Wieczorek, pronounced _A-ma-de-ows Vee-cho-reck_ or _ɑmɑdeʊʃ vieʧɔrek_ in [phonetic alphabet](/projects/phoneticalphabet).

I enjoy travel, getting to know the world, and playing sports outdoors. At work as a software engineer, I build developer tools. My goal is to supercharge your productivity.
