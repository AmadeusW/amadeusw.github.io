A few years before the [Metro interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_%28design_language%29) reached broader audiences through Windows Phone and Windows 8, Microsoft pioneered the Metro interface in the *Zune* app. The early versions of Metro, especially the one seen in Zune, was focused on typography. Currently, "metro interface" is associated with colorful, rectangular tiles:

Recreating the effect
===

I enjoyed the way Zune software looked and felt, and I wanted to create similar effect on my website

<video width="706" height="222" autoplay loop>
  <source src="{{baseurl}}/blogData/zune-animations-css/zune.webm" type="video/webm">  </video>

I liked the animation most when navigation flies in form one direction and the article flies in from another direction. The bottom half of the navigation, flies in from a little bit further source, and appears to be faster. Additionally, each of the navigation elements' animation is delayed relatively to the previous element.

Code explained
===

The origin and destination of movement are controlled by `paddingLeft` and `paddingRight` CSS properties. Fading is accomplished using the `opacity` property.

The first part of javascript selects the **header**, and sets up its animation to full opacity and 20px to the right.

```js
  $( "#"+id+" > header" ).stop()
    .css({
      'paddingLeft': '20px',
      'opacity': '0'
    })
    .animate({
      'paddingLeft': '40px',
      'opacity': '1'
    }, 'slow');
```

The second part selects the **navigation bar** below the header and sets up its animation 30px to the right.

```js
  $( "#"+id+" > nav" ).stop()
    .css({
      'paddingLeft': '10px',
    })
    .animate({
      'paddingLeft': '40px',
    }, 'slow')
    /* continued: */
```

The code then continues to find **each contained navigation element** and individually animates it to full opacity and adding extra 10px of movement. Navigation elements are dound using [`each`](https://api.jquery.com/each/) method, and animation [`delay`](https://api.jquery.com/delay/) increases for consecutive elements.

```js
    .find( "li" ).each(function(childId) {
      $(this).stop().css({
        'opacity': '0',
        'margin-right': '20px'
      })
      .delay(100 + childId*200)
      .animate({
        'opacity': '1',
        'margin-right': '30px'
      }, 'slow');
    });
```

Final note on UX
===

[@Honzie](https://twitter.com/honzie) helped me improve the fly-in animation for the article content: he pointed me to [Google's *Material Design*](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) which reminds that *everything that moves should move for a reason*, in order to mimic a physical object.

Hence, navigation left causes the article to fly in from the left side, and navigation right causes the article to fly in from the right side.

  <source src="{{baseurl}}/blogData/zune-animations-css/portfolioSections.webm" type="video/webm">  </video>

The origin and destination of animation are similarly controlled by `paddingLeft` and `paddingRight` CSS properties. `newSectionId` and `lastSectionId` are global variables that control direction of animation, and they are set in methods that handle link clicks.

```js
var initialPaddingLeft = '30px';
var initialPaddingRight = '20px';
if (newSectionId > lastSectionId)
{
  initialPaddingLeft = '50px';
  initialPaddingRight = '0px';
}
```

When changing articles (this causes the header to fly in from the left), `newSectionId` and `lastSectionId` are both equal to `0` and therefore the content flies in from the right.

```js
$( "#" + id ).stop().show()
  .css({
    'paddingLeft': initialPaddingLeft,
    'paddingRight': initialPaddingRight,
     'opacity': '0'})
  .animate({
    'paddingLeft': '40px',
    'paddingRight': '10px',
    'opacity': '1'
  }, 'slow');
```
