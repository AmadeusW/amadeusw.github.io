summary: "The epic road trip"
---

We toured the southern Iceland, going from Reykjavik to Hofn. We did a few epic hikes and managed to soak in hot water every day - scouring for hot springs is a very rewarding activity!

## Vatnajokull national park
Set out camp after a drive, and go for 7 hour hike the next day. The hike overlooked a massive glacier spilling from the highlands.

## Diamond beach
Watch icebergs flow into the ocean

## Highlands
Thorsmork. Checkout the Volcano huts and hikes there. We took a 4x4 semi-amphibous bus to get there, as you need to ford a few rivers to get there. The scenery was breathtaking, and it's a destination I would like to get back to and spend a few days there next time.

There is a very nice campsite near Seljandsfoss and this is where we hopped on the 4x4 bus inland on F249 to Thorsmork.

## Hot river
Hveragerdi hot river. Be there early in the morning before crowds come

## Reykjavik
In Reykjavík, go to “meet the natives” in the Tin Can Factory. It takes ~3 hours and you get intro to culture, languages, history and cuisine. They serve good home made food!

Also go to Braud & co and try their croissants. My favorite were pretzel croissant and granola cheese croissant.
