The Main Square, surrounding Old Town and the Wawel Castle used to be surrounded by walls. In place of walls, these days a park encircles the entirety of Old Town.</p><p>Some of the best aspects of traveling to Poland are food: high quality, huge portion sizes, and great price. Here are my recommendations:</p><h3 id=fancy-food>Fancy food</h3><p><a href=https://goo.gl/maps/Qgqmgrdxix2K67i39>Kogel Mogel Restaurant</a>
Try the soup that&rsquo;s poured on mashed potatoes, I really liked the beef cheeks and Golabki made with kasza - that&rsquo;s a cool twist as typically they&rsquo;re made with rice.</p><h3 id=fast-food>Fast food</h3><p>Bar mleczny (literally: milk bar) is a fast food cantina popular in the 20th century. You&rsquo;ll get good, Polish food for cheap. Be warned, you won&rsquo;t meet there a smiling server asking how&rsquo;s your day been. I recommend this for all sorts of dough dishes like pierogi (dumplings) and nalesniki (crepes), and I ate lunch in these every day.</p><p>All bar mleczny are decent but I can vouch for quality of <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/pZgiGmjP2HBLDjXc6>Mila</a>, they were catering food in my elementary school.</p><h3 id=street-food-zapiekanka>Street food: Zapiekanka</h3><p>Zapiekanka is a foot-long sandwich, a Krakow classic. You can get them from the round building <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/J1FCHA4e6wuMW7ND9>Okraglak</a>
which is in the center of Kazimierz. Kazimierz used to be a run down Jewish quarters and now it&rsquo;s booming as a popular diner and party destination. It&rsquo;s worth a visit at day and at night.</p><h3 id=donuts>Donuts</h3><p><a href=https://goo.gl/maps/BLSaxmRddPVGzyTj9>Krakowskie Paczki</a>
These are just the best. The biggest and fluffiest. I go for the classic with rose jam and orange glaze on top. They also serve breakfast that looked good, but I haven&rsquo;t tried it.
Make sure to go to <em>this</em> shop and not the one across the street!</p><h3 id=jazz-bar>Jazz bar</h3><p><a href=https://goo.gl/maps/7gbkj3Cm1itprS3RA>Harris Jazz Bar</a> has good drinks and music, and it seems like a popular hangout for English speaking crowd.</p><h3 id=podgorze>Podgorze</h3><p>Make your way across Vistula river on this <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/4HSKDGpUmF8UgBZu7>pedestrian bridge</a>. There&rsquo;s a lot to see on the other side! Across the Rynek Podgorski (square) there is a striking church with a park behind and painted stairs. Nearby is my high school which for a period of time had a misfortune to be turned into a Nazi HQ.</p><h3 id=nowa-huta>Nowa Huta</h3><p>For a complete change of scenery head over to &ldquo;Plac Centralny&rdquo; (&ldquo;Central square&rdquo;) - take a streetcar there! This was a socialist city built in 1950s to compete with burgeois Krakow. It housed people working in steel mills on the outskirts. A few low key recommendations in that area
