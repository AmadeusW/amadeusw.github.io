We did a few epic hikes and managed to soak in hot water every day - scouring for hot springs is a very rewarding activity!</p><h2 id=vatnajokull-national-park>Vatnajokull national park</h2><p>Set out camp after a drive, and go for 7 hour hike the next day. The hike overlooked a massive glacier spilling from the highlands.</p><h2 id=diamond-beach>Diamond beach</h2><p>Watch icebergs flow into the ocean</p><h2 id=highlands>Highlands</h2><p>Thorsmork. Checkout the Volcano huts and hikes there. We took a 4x4 semi-amphibous bus to get there, as you need to ford a few rivers to get there. The scenery was breathtaking, and it&rsquo;s a destination I would like to get back to and spend a few days there next time.</p><p>There is a very nice campsite near Seljandsfoss and this is where we hopped on the 4x4 bus inland on F249 to Thorsmork.</p><h2 id=hot-river>Hot river</h2><p>Hveragerdi hot river. Be there early in the morning before crowds come</p><h2 id=reykjavik>Reykjavik</h2><p>In Reykjavík, go to “meet the natives” in the Tin Can Factory. It takes ~3 hours and you get intro to culture, languages, history and cuisine. They serve good home made food!</p><p>Also go to Braud & co and try their croissants. My favorite were pretzel croissant and granola cheese croissant.</p></article></main><footer><span><a href=about/>//AW</a></span>
